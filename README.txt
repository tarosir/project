This is Project work for ITOVERONE
Created by Yroslav Detsky using Java 8.


The game could be opened  through Jar file.

This is desktop game. An analog of standart windows Minesweeper.
It creates a field 9X9 where 10 mines are hidden.
Goal of the player is to show the tiles under which mines are placed by puting a flag on top of it by using
Right mouse button.When  only mined tiles  remain closed the game will congratulate you on your win.
However if try to  open the tile(by using LeftMouseButton) under which the mine is located you'll get Bombed and game will end
informing you of your loss. Clicking then in any place of the field will restart the game.Also you could restart
the game at any time using middleMouse button.
Good Luck.
